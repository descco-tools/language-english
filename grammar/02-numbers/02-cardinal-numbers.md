## Separation between hundreds and tens
Hundreds and tens are usually separated by 'and' (in American English 'and' is not necessary).
- 110 - one hundred and ten
- 1,250 - one thousand, two hundred and fifty
- 2,001 - two thousand and one 

## Hundreds
Use 100 always with 'a' or 'one'.
- 100 - a hundred / one hundred

'a' can only stand at the beginning of a number.

- 100 - a hundred / one hundred
- 2,100 - two thousand, one hundred

## Thousands and Millions
Use 1,000 and 1,000,000 always with 'a' or 'one'.
- 1,000 - a thousand / one thousand
- 201,000 - two hundred and one thousand

Use commas as a separator.
- 57,458,302

## The Number 1,000,000,000

In English this number is a billion. This is very tricky for nations where 'a billion' has 12 zeros. 1,000,000,000,000 in English, however, is a trillion.

But don't worry, these numbers are even a bit problematic for native speakers: for a long time the British 'billion' had 12 zeros (a number with 9 zeros was called 'a thousand million'). Now, however, also in British English 'a billion' has 9 zeros. But from time to time this number still causes confusion (just like this paragraph, I'm afraid).

## Singular or Plural?
Numbers are usually written in singular.
- two hundred Euros
- several thousand light years

The plural is only used with dozen, hundred, thousand, million, billion, if they are not modified by another number or expression (e.g. a few / several).

- hundreds of Euros
- thousands of light years
